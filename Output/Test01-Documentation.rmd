## Test01 Documentation

This document is intended to document the RStudio project named *Test01*.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Hello World, echo=FALSE}
print("Hello World!")
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Here is how to make a list (dash - space - *item description* - 2 spaces):

- First item in the list  
- Second item in the list  
- Third item in the list  

Done with the list!
